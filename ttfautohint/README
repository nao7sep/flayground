ttfautohint 1.8.4
-----------------

by Werner Lemberg <wl@gnu.org>


This project provides a library that takes a TrueType font as the input,
removes its bytecode instructions (if any), and returns a new font where all
glyphs are bytecode hinted using the information given by FreeType's
auto-hinting module.  The idea is to provide the excellent quality of the
auto-hinter on platforms that don't use FreeType.

The library has a single API function, `TTF_autohint'; see
`lib/ttfautohint.h' for a detailed description.  Note that the library
itself won't get installed currently.

A command-line interface to the library is the `ttfautohint' program; after
compilation and installation, say

  ttfautohint --help

for usage information, or say

  man ttfautohint

to read its manual page.

A GUI to the library is `ttfautohintGUI'; it uses the Qt framework.  The
compilation of this application can be disabled with the `--without-qt'
option of the `configure' script.
